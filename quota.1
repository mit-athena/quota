.TH QUOTA 1
.SH NAME
quota \- display disk usage and limits
.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP 8
quota [\-v] [\-a | \-f filesystem [\-f filesystem ...]] [\-u] [user]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Quota
displays a user's disk usage and limits on local and NFS mounted file
systems, as well as AFS lockers that have been attached. If a user is
specified (by name or by id), \fIquota\fP will return information on
disk usage and limits for that user. Normal users can only check their
own quotas. The super-user may check any quota on local filesystems.
.PP
\fIQuota\fP, without the \fB\-a\fP or \fB\-f\fP options, only
processes local and NFS filesystems on which the user has an assigned
quota, and those AFS filesystems that the user has attached and to
which the user has write access at the filesystem's top-level
directory. Without any options, \fIquota\fP displays warnings about
those filesystems where usage is over quota. With AFS filesystems,
warnings are displayed when 90% of the volume's quota has been
reached.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \fB\-a\fP
This option specifies that all attached filesystems should be processed,
regardless of who attached them and the user's ability to write to the
filesystem.  Warnings or status messages that may result from the use of
this option do not necessarily indicate that the user may be able to
alter the usage or otherwise affect the situation.  Quota information is
a representation of a user's limits should he have write access; it does
not indicate that such write access exists.
.IP \fB\-v\fP
This option will display usages and limits for the user on all
processed file systems where quotas exist. On NFS or local file
systems, everyone has a "soft" limit for disk space usage (given in
the first
.B quota
column) and a
"hard" limit (given in the first
.B limit
column).  The amount of space
currently in use is shown in the
.B usage
column.  These values
are measured in kilobytes.
.IP
When the "soft" limit is exceeded, the
.B limit
column will be marked with \fB<<\fP. If the higher "hard" limit is
reached, you will no longer be able to write anything into the
directory.
.IP
In addition, there is a quota and limit on the number of inodes (files and
directories) that may exist.  Each file or directory counts as a single inode
(the sum total of which is listed in the
.B files
column).  The soft and hard
limits for inodes are similar to those for disk space usage, except that when
the "hard" limit is reached, you will not be able to create new subdirectories
or files within that filesystem.
.IP
If no quotas for the user (or groups that the user is a member of) exist
on any mounted file systems, nothing will be displayed.
.IP
In an AFS locker, there is no quota on the number of files you can
create as long as your disk usage remains under quota.
.PP
.IP "\fB\-f\fP filesystem"
With this option, quota information will be returned on any specified
filesystems.  The filesystem must be specified as the mount-point or as
the Hesiod name by which it was attached.  A single filesystem name
must be present with each \fB\-f\fP option.  For example, a typical
command to check one's home directory quota would be:
.PP
.RS 16
quota -v -f $USER
.RE
.IP
Up to 16 `\fB\-f\fP filesystem' pairs may be specified.  If the given
filesystem name doesn't match any mounted filesystems, a suitable
error message to that effect is printed.
.IP
Note that the user will always be warned about quota problems on lockers
that are explicitly specified with -f, whether or not they have write
access to the filesystem.  Quota is a representation of limits that the
user would have should he have write access; it does not indicate if
such write access exists.
.PP
.IP \fB\-u\fP
This option indicates that user quotas, and not group quotas, are to
be reported verbosely. Group quotas are no longer supported, so this
option is now equivalent to the \fB\-v\fP option.
