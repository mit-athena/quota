.IX "quota command"  ""  "\fLquota\fP \(em display disk usage and limits"
.IX "file system"  "display disk usage and limits quota" ""  "display disk usage and limits \(em \fLquota\fP"
.IX display  "disk usage and limits quota"  ""  "disk usage and limits \(em \fLquota\fP"
.IX  "limits of disk space quota"  ""  "limits of disk space \(em \fLquota\fP"
.I Quota
displays users' and groups' disk usage and limits on local and NFS mounted file
systems.  If a user or group is specified (by name or by id), \fIquota\fP will
return what information it can obtain on disk usage and limits for the given
user or group.  The super-user may check quotas for any user and group on 
local filesystems.  Normal users may only check their own user quotas and the
quotas of any group they're a member of.
.LP
.I Quota
without options displays only warnings 
about mounted file systems where usage is over quota.
.SH OPTIONS

.IP \fB\-v\fP
This option will display
usages and limits for the user and any groups the user is a member of
on all local and NFS mounted file systems where quotas exist, in the following
format:

.nf
.if n .in -.75in
.if n .ta 1.3i 2.0i 2.8i 3.5i 4.5i 5.2i 5.9i 6.6i
.if t .ta .9i 1.4i 2.1i 2.7i 3.4i 4.2i 4.6i 5.2i
Disk quotas for krishna (uid 69):
Filesystem	Type	ID	usage	quota	limit	files	quota	limit
/mit/krishna	user	krishna	2394	2000	2400<<	313	1000	1200

User krishna over disk quota on /mit/krishna, remove 395K within 7.0 days
.ta .5in
.if n .in +.755i
.fi

Everyone has a "soft" limit for disk space usage (given in the first
.B quota
column) and a
"hard" limit (given in the first
.B limit
column).  The amount of space
currently in use is shown in the
.B usage
column.  These values
are measured in kilobytes (1024 characters).

When the "soft" limit is exceeded, the
.B limit
column will be marked with \fB<<\fP,
as shown above.  If the higher "hard" limit is reached, you will no longer be
able to write anything into the directory.  Also, if you wait until the seven
days time limit runs out, the "soft" limit will become the "hard" limit.

In addition, there is a quota and limit on the number of inodes (files and
directories) that may exist.  Each file or directory counts as a single inode
(the sum total of which is listed in the
.B files
column).  The soft and hard
limits for inodes are similar to those for disk space usage, except that when
the "hard" limit is reached, you will not be able to create new subdirectories
or files within that filesystem.

If no quotas for the user (or groups that the user is a member of) exist on any
local or NFS mounted file systems, nothing will be displayed.
.IP \fB\-f\fP dirname
With this option, quota information will be returned on any filesystems whose
mount-points begin with the given directory name.  A single directory name
must be present with each \fB\-f\fP option.  For example, a typical command to
check one's home directory quota would be:
.nf
.ta .3i

	quota -v -f\  ~
.fi

Up to 16 `\fB\-f\fP dirname' pairs may be specified.

.IP \fB\-u\fP
This option will only report user quota information (ie. no group quotas), 
in the following format:

.nf
.if n .in -.75in
.if n .ta 1.3i 2.0i 2.7i 3.5i 4.5i 5.2i 5.9i 6.6i
.if t .ta .9i 1.4i 2.1i 2.7i 3.4i 4.2i 4.6i 5.2i
Disk quotas for user krishna (uid 69):
Filesystem	usage	quota	limit	timeleft	files	quota	limit	timeleft
/mit/krishna	2394	2000	2400	7.0 days	313	1000	1200
.if n .in +.755i
.fi
.IP \fB\-g\fP
Similar to the \fB-u\fP option, but reports only group quota information.  At
least one group must be specified on the command line.
