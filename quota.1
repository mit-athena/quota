Without a username or UID after the -v, this option will display disk
block usage and quotas for the user and any groups the user is a member
of on all mounted file systems where quotas exist.

With a username or UID, this option will display user disk block and
inode usages and quotas for the given user on locally mounted file
systems.
.IP \fB\-i\fP
In combination with the -v option above, this will cause inode usages
and quotas to be displayed instead of disk block.
.IP \fB\-g\fP
With a group name or GID, this option will display group disk block
and inode usages and limits for the given group on locally mounted
file systems.  This option is useful only to the super-user.
